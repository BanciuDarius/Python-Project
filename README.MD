Hello and welcome to my repo about Python 3.

Here are all the things that I learned during the IT Factory Course for Automation Tester license.

In the repository you can find date base structures like variables, lists, dictionaries, if else condition, while loop, abstract methods
and how to make classes and abstract classes in Python.
